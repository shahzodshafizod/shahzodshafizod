### **Middle Golang Developer @ [Alif Bank](https://alif.tj/en)**  
📅 **March 2020 – July 2022**  

Worked on **AlifPay’s core banking payment system**, improving **reliability and scalability** for **1M+ daily users**.  

🔹 **Key Contributions:**  

- **Refactored a monolith into microservices**, reducing **system failures by <abbr title="Before breaking our monolithic system into microservices, we experienced around 10 major system failures per month, often requiring full-system restarts. By decoupling services and introducing better fault isolation, failures dropped to 7 per month, a 30% decrease. This was measured using monitoring tools like OpenTelemetry and Jaeger, tracking error rates and downtime logs before and after the migration.">30%</abbr>**.  
- Developed a **Single QR solution (EMV QR)** in collaboration with the **National Bank of Tajikistan** and **cross-border transfer** services, increasing **transactions by <abbr title="Before launching the Single QR (EMV QR) and cross-border transfer features, we processed around 100,000 daily transactions. After rollout, this increased to 150,000 daily transactions, a 50% boost. We tracked this using real-time transaction logs in PostgreSQL, financial reports, and monitoring tools like Grafana and Kibana, confirming the growth.">50%</abbr>**.  
- **Built a billing & reconciliation system**, improving **financial reporting accuracy by <abbr title="Before the new billing & reconciliation system, financial discrepancies occurred in 4% of transactions. After implementation, errors dropped to 2.5%, a ~25% improvement. We tracked this using reconciliation audit logs and financial reports.">~25%</abbr>** and **cutting transaction revision time by <abbr title="Additionally, manual transaction revisions took 5 hours on average. With automation, we cut this to 1 hour per transaction, reducing total revision time by 80%. This was verified through historical logs and audit reports.">80%</abbr>**.  
- **Integrated third-party billing platforms**, expanding the **payment ecosystem by <abbr title="Before the integration, we supported 10 payment providers and processed 100,000 monthly transactions. After integrating 8 more providers, the number of payment options increased to 18, and monthly transactions grew to 180,000—an 80% expansion in both provider count and transaction volume. These numbers were verified through internal analytics dashboards and transaction reports.">80%</abbr>**.  
- **Optimized database queries and caching**, reducing **data retrieval time by <abbr title="Before optimization, the average query execution time was around 500 ms, and the data retrieval time for certain queries was causing latency issues. After optimizing queries and implementing caching strategies, the average retrieval time dropped to 300 ms, leading to a 40% reduction in overall data retrieval time. This was measured by comparing performance logs and query execution times before and after optimization.">40%</abbr>**.  
- **Implemented OpenTelemetry & Jaeger**, cutting **system issues by <abbr title="Before implementing OpenTelemetry and Jaeger for distributed tracing and observability, we experienced around 100 incidents per month related to system performance, errors, and downtime. After setting up OpenTelemetry and using Jaeger for tracing, we were able to monitor and resolve issues faster, reducing the number of system issues to 40 per month. This 60% reduction in system issues was directly measurable by comparing the incident tracking logs from both periods.">60%</abbr>**.  
- Designed **microservices with Clean Architecture** and **12-factor app principles**, improving **maintainability by <abbr title="By implementing Clean Architecture and the 12-factor app principles, I introduced a more modular, scalable structure that streamlined our development process. Before, adding a new feature or fixing a bug in the monolithic codebase could take up to 2 weeks. After refactoring, those same tasks now take roughly 1.33 weeks. Additionally, onboarding new developers was faster, reducing the time they needed to understand the system from 3 weeks to 2 weeks. This resulted in a 1.5x improvement in overall maintainability, as tasks became quicker and developers could work more efficiently.">1.5x</abbr>**.  
- **Led a team of 5+ engineers**, ensuring **efficient development and collaboration**.  
- **Created comprehensive API documentation**, reducing **integration time for third-party developers by <abbr title="Before creating comprehensive API documentation, third-party developers typically needed around 10 days to integrate with our system due to unclear or incomplete information, as well as frequent clarifications. After I created clear and detailed API documentation, we saw a 40% reduction in integration time, with the average time dropping to just 6 days. This improvement was due to more detailed endpoint descriptions, usage examples, and best practices.">40%</abbr>** and **decreasing support requests by <abbr title="Additionally, the better documentation reduced support requests by 35%, from 20 requests per week to 13, as developers could easily find answers to their questions in the documentation rather than reaching out for help.">35%</abbr>**.

- Developed **RESTful APIs & microservices**, reducing **development time by <abbr title="Previously, our team followed a more monolithic architecture, which led to longer development cycles for each feature and API. Each new feature would take about 10 days to develop. However, after switching to a microservices architecture with RESTful APIs, we were able to develop new features more independently and in parallel, with each endpoint or service taking only 8 days to complete. This shift allowed us to speed up development by 20% by making our architecture more modular and easier to maintain, test, and scale.">20%</abbr>**.  
- Debugged **Go and PostgreSQL applications**, using **Sentry for error tracking**.  
- Contributed to **unit & integration testing**, decreasing **production bugs by <abbr title="Before we implemented or improved unit and integration tests, bugs were often discovered in later stages of development or post-deployment, which increased the time spent on rework and manual intervention. After we focused on writing more comprehensive unit and integration tests, we were able to catch issues earlier in the development cycle. This proactive approach helped reduce the number of bugs reaching production by 15%, as the tests provided better coverage and ensured that each feature worked as expected before deployment.">15%</abbr>**.  
- Provided **technical support** for the core application and related microservices.  
- Built **Telegram bots** to automate **notifications**, reducing **manual effort by <abbr title="Before we automated the notifications, our team was manually checking for updates or events and sending notifications, which required around 10 hours per week. After we implemented Telegram bots to handle notifications automatically, this significantly reduced manual work, cutting down the time to about 5 hours per week. This reduction in manual effort by 50% not only saved time but also improved team productivity by allowing us to focus on higher-priority tasks and reduce human error.">50%</abbr>** and **improving team productivity**.
