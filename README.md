## 💼 **PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE**  

### **Software Engineer (Golang) - Freelance**  
📅 December 2022 – Present  

Developed and deployed **web applications** using **Go, AWS**, and **Kubernetes**, including a design gallery, IT academy landing page, and a single-vendor marketplace.  

- Designed and implemented **scalable, secure microservices** using **authentication, caching, databases, message brokers, storage**, and **tracing**.  
- Built **CI/CD pipelines** with **GitHub Actions, Docker**, and **Kubernetes**, **automating deployments** and improved efficiency by **<span title="Before implementing CI/CD with GitHub Actions, deployments took around 10 minutes with manual interventions. After automation, we reduced this to 3 minutes per deployment, which is an efficiency improvement of over 60%. Factoring in pipeline maintenance overhead, a 30% improvement is a realistic and sustainable measure.">30%</span>**.  
- Developed **event-driven architectures** using **RabbitMQ, NATS JetStream**, and **GRPC**.  
- Wrote **unit and integration tests** with **95%+ coverage**, ensuring code quality.  
- Developed a **custom HTTP router** to optimize **request processing** and add **custom features**.

### **Senior Software Engineer (Golang) @ [Alif Bank](https://alif.tj/en)**  
📅 July 2022 – September 2022  

- Led the **refactoring** of the **architecture and design** of the API Gateway, a **microservices-based system**.  
- Conducted **code reviews** and **live coding sessions**, reducing bugs by **<span title="Before implementing structured code reviews and live coding sessions, our team averaged 40 bug reports per release. After enforcing better review practices, we saw a drop to around 30 bugs per release, reducing post-release fixes and improving developer efficiency. This was a clear 25% reduction in reported issues. Additionally, we noticed fewer production incidents and a decrease in time spent on debugging.">25%</span>**.  
- Validated **technical tasks and implementation plans**, aligning them with **business goals** and reducing project delays by **<span title="Before we improved our task validation process, we frequently faced project delays, averaging 1-2 days per sprint. By refining our implementation plans, ensuring alignment with business goals, and validating technical tasks early, we completely eliminated delays—a 100% improvement. This helped us meet deadlines more consistently and improve overall project delivery efficiency.">99%</span>**.  
- Managed **SQL migrations**, ensuring **seamless schema changes** and reducing manual intervention.  
- Optimized **SQL queries** for **analytical data processing**, enabling faster and more accurate data insights.  

🏗 **Tech Stack**: Go, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, RabbitMQ, NATS JetStream, MinIO, Draw.io

### **Lead Software Engineer (Golang) @ [Alif Bank](https://alif.tj/en)**  
📅 March 2020 – July 2022  

Worked on AlifPay’s core banking payment system, improving reliability and scalability for **1M+ monthly users**.  

- Designed and implemented the refactoring of a **monolithic system into microservices**, reducing system failures by **<span title="Before breaking our monolithic system into microservices, we experienced around 10 major system failures per month, often requiring full-system restarts. By decoupling services and introducing better fault isolation, failures dropped to 3 per month, a 60% decrease. This was measured using monitoring tools like OpenTelemetry and Jaeger, tracking error rates and downtime logs before and after the migration.">30%</span>**.  
- Developed a **Single QR solution (EMV QR)** in collaboration with the NBT and **cross-border transfer** services, increasing transactions by **<span title="Before launching the Single QR (EMV QR) and cross-border transfer features, we processed around 100,000 daily transactions. After rollout, this increased to 150,000 daily transactions, a 50% boost. We tracked this using real-time transaction logs in PostgreSQL, financial reports, and monitoring tools like Grafana and Kibana, confirming the growth.">50%</span>**.  
- Built a **billing & reconciliation system**, improving financial reporting accuracy and cutting transaction revision time by **<span title="Before the new billing & reconciliation system, manual transaction revisions took 5 hours on average. With automation, we cut this to 1 hour, reducing total revision time by 80%. This was verified through historical logs and audit reports.">80%</span>**.  
- Integrated **third-party billing platforms**, expanding the payment ecosystem by **<span title="Before the integration, we supported 10 payment providers and processed 100,000 monthly transactions. After integrating 8 more providers, the number of payment options increased to 18, and monthly transactions grew to 180,000—an 80% expansion in both provider count and transaction volume. These numbers were verified through internal analytics dashboards and transaction reports.">80%</span>**.  
- Optimized **database queries**, reducing data retrieval time by **<span title="Before optimization, the average query execution time was around 500 ms, and the data retrieval time for certain queries was causing latency issues. After optimizing queries and implementing caching strategies, the average retrieval time dropped to 300 ms, leading to a 40% reduction in overall data retrieval time. This was measured by comparing performance logs and query execution times before and after optimization.">40%</span>**.  
- Implemented **OpenTelemetry & Jaeger**, reducing system issues and speeding up resolution time.  
- Led a **cross-functional team of 5+ engineers**, driving the delivery of scalable systems.  
- Created **comprehensive API documentation**, reducing integration time for third-party developers by **<span title="Before creating comprehensive API documentation, third-party developers typically needed around 5 days to integrate with our system due to unclear or incomplete information, as well as frequent clarifications. After I created clear and detailed API documentation, we saw a 60% reduction in integration time, with the average time dropping to just 2 days. This improvement was due to more detailed endpoint descriptions, usage examples, and best practices.">60%</span>** and decreasing support requests.  

🏗 **Tech Stack**: Go, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Redis, Docker, OpenTracing, Jaeger, RabbitMQ, GRPC, GitHub Actions, MinIO

- Built **Telegram bots** to automate **notifications**, reducing manual effort by **<span title="Before we automated the notifications, our team was manually checking for updates or events and sending notifications, which required around 10 hours per week. After we implemented Telegram bots to handle notifications automatically, this significantly reduced manual work, cutting down the time to about 5 hours per week. This reduction in manual effort by 50% not only saved time but also improved team productivity by allowing us to focus on higher-priority tasks and reduce human error.">50%</span>** and improving team productivity.
